# Third Umpire Decision Review System

The Umpire Decision Review System (UDRS or simply DRS) is a technology-based system used in cricket to assist the match officials their decision-making. On-field umpires may choose to consult with the third umpire (known as an Umpire Review), and players may request that the third umpire consider a decision of the on-field umpires (known as a Player Review).

The main elements that have been used are television replays, technology that tracks the path of the ball and predicts what it would have done, microphones to detect small sounds made as the ball hits bat or pad, and infra-red imaging to detect temperature changes as the ball hits the bat or pad.

So, here it is the decision review system using python which will take an accurate decision about whether the batsman is out or not out.
